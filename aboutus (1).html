    <h1>About Us</h1>
    Welcome to our website dedicated to exploring the impacts of pollution on pollinators! We are a group of enthusiastic first-year BTech students passionate about environmental science and conservation. Our mission is to raise awareness about the critical role pollinators play in our ecosystem and how pollution threatens theirsurvival.<br><br>

<h2>Our Goals</h2>

<b><u>Education:</u></b> We aim to educate the public about the various types of pollution—air, water, and soil—and their detrimental effects on pollinator populations.<br><br>

<b><u>Research:</u></b> Our team is committed to researching the latest findings on pollution's impact on pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and other essential species.<br><br>

<b><u>Advocacy:</u></b> We advocate for sustainable practices and policies that protect pollinators from pollution and habitat loss.

<h3>Why Pollinators Matter?</h3>

Pollinators are vital for the reproduction of many plants, including crops that humans rely on for food. Unfortunately, pollution poses significant threats to their health and habitats. By understanding these impacts, we hope to inspire action and promote conservation efforts.
